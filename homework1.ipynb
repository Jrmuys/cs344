    "Introspection is the process of analyzing one's own thoughts. This can be done either by thinking about your own thoughts or by asking others what they are thinking and why they are thinking those things. This method of studying the human mind was very ineffective because we are bad at interpreting what we are thinking and have no way of knowing what goes on in our subconscious because, by definition, it is impossible to access our subconscious from our conscious minds. \n",

    "In AI, we need a reliable model to base human mental processes off to get something artificially intelligent. Early researchers tried to use introspection to get this model, however, it is not a good way to do this because our cognitive processes are abstracted one layer above our subconscious and we have no way of interpreting how those subconscious processes take place by thinking about it.

    "For the initial value in my implementation of the traveling salesman problem I am using a list of the cities 0 through n (the number of cities in the problem) and shuffling them to get a random start. The actions are defined by tuples representing all the possible swaps between cities on the route. The results come back as a list that has had a swap operation from the two cities in the action. The value function finds the distances that were randomly generated at the initialization of the problem in a symmetric matrix so that the distance to each city is the same both ways."

I am using the hill-climbing algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm with 100 random restarts to see which one does better over a wider sample. Overall, the simulated annealing algorithm works better than hill climbing. This is because the solution space for TSPs is spread out, which lends its self to simulated annealing, however, the hill climbing algorithm finds a decently good solution as well."
