=========================

Exercise 2.1
------------
    a.  both of the search algorithms solve the problem. They both do equally well and achieve a value of 15.0 at the
        end, no matter the start location.
    b.  Simulated annealing takes longer because it makes lots of random moves to get to the maximum location,
        whereas the hill-climbing algorithm just moves up the slope until it reaches the maximum value and then stops.
    c.  The starting value for x doesn't make a difference in finding the correct solution, however, it does make a
        difference in the time it takes, especially for the hill climbing algorithm because it needs to climb farther
        to reach the peak (although in this scenario, not that much farther)
    d.  Changing the delta value makes both algorithm take longer. For the hill climbing algorithm, the max value get
        lots of decimal places because it can only go up by the delta value. Trying a number like 0.1 or 0.01 doesn't
        come out with a even integer even though it should. I am guessing that has something to do with the way that
        it is adding numbers. The hill climbing algorithm doesn't always find the maximum point if they delta is too
        small, but will usually get pretty close to 15.
    e.  The exp_schedule() method is the function that determines if the solution is accepted. It takes values that are
        higher but this function allows some values that are lower.

Exercise 2.2
-------------
    a.  Neither can 'solve' the problem because the solution is infinity. However, depending on what value of delta
        used, the simulated annealing generally finds a better solution.
    b.  The hill climbing algorithm will work more quickly (usually) because once it finds one of the peaks, it will
        stop, however the simulated annealing algorithm will keep going until the temperature 'cools'.
    c.  The starting value for x makes a huge difference for the hill climbing algorithm, this is because the hill
        climbing algorithm can only go the the peak of whatever slope it starts on, so its final value is determined by
        its starting location (unless it starts at a value of 0).
    d.  Changing the delta step make a large difference for the simulated annealing algorithm because if the delta is
        too small, it won't be able to make it out of the troughs and will be as stuck as the hill-climbing algorithm.
        If the delta is large enough, it can find a better place to go next and generally can get a better value than
        hill-climbing. For hill climbing, if the delta is large enough, it can jump to a higher peak. If delta is
        specifically a multiple of pi (> pi ex. 3.14,31.4) it can jump (almost) perfectly to the next peak and find a
        very good value (better than simulated annealing)
    e.  The function (as stated) doesn't have lower and upper bounds. It will be able to find as high a value it can
        in the time given. The minimum value is 0 because it uses the absolute value function. Assuming a normal delta
        value (not anything huge or pi), the hill climbing algorithm will stay at 30 or lower for the value, and
        simulated annealing will generally do so, but it can escape past 30 because it can jump to the next peak.
