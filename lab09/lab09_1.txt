a. The linear regression was not effective for the problem. The solution only got slightly better as it trained
so it does not work well.

b. b. Logloss is better for classification because a highly predictive answer is given more wheight than a less
confident answer, such as 0.999 vs 0.9 which have much different confidences. In L2 loss these would be treated
similarly but in logloss, since it uses a logarithmic approach, it can distinguish between higher and lower confidence.

c. Logistic regression was much more effective than linear regression. There was a noticeable decline in logloss
error over the training session which shows that it was able to learn much better than linear regression was.

d. linear_classifier = train_linear_classifier_model(
    learning_rate=0.000005,
    steps=10000,
    batch_size=300,
    training_examples=training_examples,

    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Model training finished.
AUC on the validation set: 0.80
Accuracy on the validation set: 0.79
