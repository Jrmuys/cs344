=========================

Exercise 3.1
------------
a.  For the solved puzzle, every algorithm worked to solve the problem in a timely manner.
    For the easy puzzle (and for the hard ones), depth_first_search and min_conflics don't find a solution in a timely
    manner. DFS is slow because the search space becomes very large for the sudoku problem and min_conflics doesn't work
    well because it implements local search which doesn't do well if the solutions arn't spread out in the problem
    space.ACM solves the easy problem but not anything after that because it doesn't do any backtracking, so if it gets
    to a place where no moves can be made, it is stuck and fails. Backtracking search with the added parameters can
    solve the problem because there is a very small (probably 1) solution for the problem, so backtracking search (if
    it's a bit smarter) can accomplish the task because it doesn't fail when if finds something that doesn't work.

b.  Configuring the settings for backtracking makes the backtracking algorithm work on the harder and hardest problems
    and improves the search time for the easy problem. T
    The inference parameter has a big effect on the effectiveness of the algorithm. The select_unassigned_variable
    param doesn't have a noticeable effect on the program's runtime.

Exercise 3.2
------------
a.  DFS: Fails for every value of n. This is possibly because of a bug with the implementation of the algorithm.
    AC3: Fails for every value of n.
    backtracking: n=25 is the largest value I had patience for. For the n queens problem, with larger values of n,
                  the search has to do more and more moves to find a solution, which ends up taking a long time
    min_conflicts: at n=2000 the algorithm starts to take more time to find a solution. min_conflicts works so well
                   because in the n queens problem, the solutions are more spread out so local search is a great
                   algorithm to use.
b.  The mrv setting works the best for the n-queens problem. This is because this parameter limits the search space for
    the algorithm and means that it can search deeper faster which is helpful for this problem. The inference doesn't
    really help because the increased search space makes it take super long, and looking at the constraints doesn't
    limit the search space much.

Exercise 3.3
------------
a.  A csp as defined by the aima program is:
        variables   A list of variables
        domains     A dictionary of possible values
        neighbors   A dictionary of variables that lists the other variables that participate in constraints.
        constraints A function f(A, a, B, b) that returns true if neighbors
                    A, B satisfy the constraint when they have values A=a, B=b

    A traditional search is defined by
        start       A starting state
        actions     A list of action to go from one state to another
        domain      The states that can be reached by the actions (not usually explicitly defines)
        goal        The state the program is searching for
        results     The result from taking an action on a certain state

    These two are similar in that they have domains and try to search for a possible solution, but the constraint
    satisfaction search takes into account the constraints while searching for the solution and only considers
    options that fit those constraints.

b.  Heuristics for traditional and constraint based searches are similar because they both are used for complex problems
    that require more help to guide them to the correct result faster. In min-conflicts, the heuristic of how many
    conflicts the state has and picks a random variable to minimize conflicts with. This uses the constraints in the
    heuristic to find a solution, where as a traditional search can only use a pre defined heuristic like the distance
    to a location.
