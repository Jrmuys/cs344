1. I would rather use Keras to build models because it is much easier to use than tensor flow. Keras also
uses tensor flow, so you still get the functionality of tensor flow without havn't to write
tensorflow code.

2.
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.002,
    steps=5000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 8],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Final RMSE (on training data):   105.39
Final RMSE (on validation data): 106.25

Part 2:
Final RMSE (on test data): 116.69
