a. The confusion matrix shows the actual and predicted for each of the labels, this shows if anything is being confused
for something else, something that can happen with handwritten digits.

b. The tensorflow network uses only 2 layers with 100 neurons each whereas the keras network used 3 layers with
convolutions and max pooling. I got an imporved accuracy when reducing the neurons per layer and increasing the learning
rate.

c.
The visualization for 10 steps is much more noisy than for 1000, it seems a lot more random. You can make out
distinct shapes in the 1000 steps which suggests it is finding patterns to latch on to in the model.
