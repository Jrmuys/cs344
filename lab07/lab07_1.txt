This allows for operations to be done on a data set even when it is not complete which can be the case with
real world data.

Pandas helps to abstract the data processing and helps to organize data to perform operations. It allows easy
transformation, manipulation, and analysis of data more easily than using numpy and matplotlib and more individually.

In case the data comes in ordered and you want to make sure the data analysis isn't biased by trends that happen over
time in sequential order rather than in the data itself. It also makes sure the data is more representative of the
whole because data at the start and end of the data set can be taken in equally.
